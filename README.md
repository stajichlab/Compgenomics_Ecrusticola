# Exophiala crusticola comparative genomics project
This repo is dedicated to the assembly, annotation, and comparative genomic analysis of Exophiala crusticola (the architypal biocrust black yeast). A documented phenotype of E. crusticola is the ability to produce copious exopolysaccharides (EPS). This is thought to be key characteristic that facilitates the stabilization of biological soil crusts (biocrusts). Moreover, E. crusticola has only been described in soil, and is the only biocrust fungus thought to be endemic to biocrusts. I want to see if it has any unique properties, especially related to EPS production.
